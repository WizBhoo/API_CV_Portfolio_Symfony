## Project purpose

*   Graduate PHP / Symfony backend developer, I would like to improve my skills by working on a personal project based on Symfony.
*   During my conversion to become a developer, I have developed my first CV & Portfolio Website entirely in PHP without using any Framework.
*   Now, I'm able to rework it with Symfony, so, let's do it !
*   This project starts based on my personal website [version 1.0](https://github.com/WizBhoo/OCR_P05_Site_CV-Blog)
